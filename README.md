## Behaviour Driven Development

BDD focuses on how the user will interact with the application.

What you will see and experience:

1. Landing page with several quotes on sticky notes tilted for effects.
2. Hover or focus on the note to remove the tilting effect; read effectively.<br>
    Note - Quote, Author, Thumbs up and Thumbs down are displayed.
3. Click on the **Thumbs up** to up vote and **Thumbs down** to down vote.<br> 
    This increments the value adjascent.<br>
    **NB** The quote with the most votes is highlighted in Orange.
4. Click on View more to display:
    - Uploaded By - name of the person who uploaded the quote.
    - Tag - Either Humor me or Inspire and Motivate.
    - Delete button - Removes the Quote from display.
    - How many days have passed since the quote was added.

5. At the bottom is an add quote form.<br> 
    Enter your name, Author, Quote and Tag to create a new quote on submit.<br>
    The form throws errors below the inputs for empty values and cannot submit an empty form.
6. Click on the Reload to Clear the form.
7. Finally is a footer with contact information.<br>
